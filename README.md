Greetings! I'm a 26 y.o. brazilian software developer with background on electrical engineering. I have over 4 years of experience in the tech industry, and most of my experiences were in tech startups.


I have mostly worked on backend, and i'm currently striving to achieve mastery on it, but i don't discard doing more frontend work in the future.


Despite being a pragmatic developer, i take an artisan's approach in my work and like to make things the right way whenever i can, after all i complete agree with the Zen of Python in "Beautiful is better than ugly". There's an art embedded in software development, and the pursuit of the elegant solution is a very motivating thought process.
