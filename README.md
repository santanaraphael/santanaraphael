Greetings! I'm a brazilian software developer with background on electrical engineering. I have over 4
years of experience in the tech industry, and most of my experiences were in tech startups.
I am mostly a backend developer, and working on my mastery on it. Although i don't discard moving into
fullstack territory, it's not on my plans for the near future.


Despite being a pragmatic developer, i take an artisan's approach in my work and like to make
things the right way whenever i can. After all, i completely agree with the Zen of Python in
"Beautiful is better than ugly". There's an art embedded in software development, and
the pursuit of the elegant solution is a very motivating thought process.

Some of my hobbies are:
- Playing Runescape
- Playing Sudoku
- Rocking the acoustic guitar 🎸
- Taking care of my cats 🐈
- Hiking
- Happy Hours 🍻
