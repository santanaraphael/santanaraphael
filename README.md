Greetings! I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer with a background in electrical engineering and over 7 years of experience in the tech industry, primarily working in tech startups. I specialize in backend development, applying engineering principles to design and build scalable and efficient systems.

As a pragmatic engineer, I take an artisan's approach to my work, striving to do things the right way whenever possible. I fully embrace the Zen of Python's principle: "Beautiful is better than ugly." and, as Leonardo da Vinci once said, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." For me, creating elegant and efficient solutions is not just about functionalityâ€”it's about crafting software that stands the test of time

In my free time, you'll find me playing Runescape, solving Sudoku puzzles, strumming the acoustic guitar, caring for my cats, or running along Copacabana Beach.
